#parse date-stamp of satellite image from satellite image file name (this will be an exact date on the calendar)
#create a new field to collect "x days since street was swept" + "satellite image date-stamp"
#parse recurring schedule text string
#calculate latest date in which the street sweeping was done (new project function)
#calculate the delta = date the satellite image was captured (water quality date-stamp) - last date that the street was swept (from street sweeping schedule spreadsheet)
